The goal of wetried is to be a Smith College version of the nbastatr package -- with it, you can see the Smith College basketball team's stats and calculate various advanced stats and other important numbers for anyone with an interest in basketball stats.

## Installation

You can install the development version of wetried2 like so:

``` {r}
devtools::install_github("chiqiu23/wetried")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(wetried2)
## basic example code
```

## Available Tables

-   `smith_wbb_data`: dataset of Smith College women basketball games

```{r wbb data}
library(readr)
smith_wbb_data <- read_csv("smith_wbb_data.csv")
head(smith_wbb_data)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot()
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
